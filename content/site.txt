Description: 

Lucas Vasilko is a photographer with a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design, currently working and living in Brooklyn, NY.

Lucas defines himself as a photographer by project.  He works from series to series or job to job, gravitating towards not one specific subject in particular but rather anything that seems to speak out to him. 

His images communicate best by storytelling through books, sequence, and editorial narrative.
